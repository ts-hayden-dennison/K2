ALBOW - A Little Bit of Widgetry for PyGame
-------------------------------------------

Version 1.1

This is a rather basic, no-frills widget set for creating a GUI using
PyGame. It has been developed over the course of my last three
PyWeek competition entries.

Contents

            on your PYTHONPATH or in the top level directory
            of your PyGame application.
            
demo.py     A demonstration of most of Albow's functionality.
